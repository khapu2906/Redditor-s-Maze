## **5. Gameplay Flow**

1. **Start the Game**:
   - Players enter a keyword/hashtag to find relevant posts on Reddit.
   - Players choose the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

2. **Play Level 1**:
   - Each Reddit post serves as one level in the game.
   - Players must answer the related questions correctly.
   - Correct answers within the time limit earn points.
   - After completing a level, the player will be directed to the next random level (not in sequential order). The path to the next level depends on the answers, and choosing the best path can lead to faster progression.

3. **Proceed to the Next Level**:
   - After completing one level, the player advances to the next Reddit post.
   - Points from answers and time will accumulate.

4. **End of Game**:
   - Players continue until they finish all posts or cannot answer any more questions correctly.
   - Final points are calculated by summing up points from all levels and any bonuses for completing the maze.
   - Players must strategically plan their path and timing to maximize their points, as completing the maze quickly does not necessarily yield the highest score.
